# NINJA BRAIN!

> Transform Your Notes Into Questions Instantly


## 🥷 The Idea Behind Ninja Brain

Navigating school can be a maze of challenges—test anxiety, managing time, and the ever-present task of studying. We've all been there: diligently taking notes, but when it comes time to use them, they often fall short.

We began brainstorming ways to make the notes we invest so much time in actually effective for studying.

Amidst a whirlwind of ideas, we finally discovered a solution... NINJA BRAIN!
